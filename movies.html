        In 1962, tough bouncer Frank "Tony Lip" Vallelonga searches for work while his nightclub is closed for renovations.
         The most promising offer turns out to be the driver for African-American classical<br> pianist Don Shirley for a concert 
         tour into the Deep South states. Although hardly enthused at working for a Black man, Tony accepts the job and they
          begin their trek armed with "The Negro Motorist<br> Green Book," a guide for safe travel through America's racial segregation. 
          The snobbishly erudite pianist and the crudely practical bouncer can barely get along with their clashing attitudes to life 
          and<br> ideals. However, as the disparate pair witness and endure America's appalling injustices on the road, they find a 
          newfound respect for each other's talents and start to face them together. In doing so, they<br> nurture an understanding and
           a friendship that would change both their lives.</p>

        On a fall night in 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer programming genius Mark Zuckerberg sits down at his computer and
